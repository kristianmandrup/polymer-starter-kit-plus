Getting Started
---------------

To take advantage of Polymer Starter Kit Plus you need to:

1.	Get a copy of the code.
2.	Install the dependencies if you don't already have them.
3.	Modify the application to your liking.
4.	Deploy your production code.

### 1. Get the code

[Download](https://github.com/StartPolymer/polymer-starter-kit-plus/releases/latest) and extract Polymer Starter Kit Plus to where you want to work.

Or `git clone https://github.com/StartPolymer/polymer-starter-kit-plus.git <my-repo-name>`

#### Updating from previous version

If you've previously downloaded a copy of the full Starter Kit and would like to update to the latest version, here's a git workflow for doing so:

```sh
git init
git checkout -b master
git add .
git commit -m 'Check-in 1.0.1'
git remote add upstream https://github.com/StartPolymer/polymer-starter-kit-plus.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
# resolve the merge conflicts in your editor
git add . -u
git commit -m 'Updated to 1.0.2'
```

### 2. Install dependencies

#### Quick-start (for experienced users)

With Node.js installed, run the following one liner from the root of your Polymer Starter Kit Plus download:

```sh
npm run-script install-all
```

#### Prerequisites (for everyone)

The full starter kit requires the following major dependencies:

-	Node.js, used to run JavaScript tools from the command line.
-	npm, the node package manager, installed with Node.js and used to install Node.js packages.
-	gulp, a Node.js-based build tool.
-	bower, a Node.js-based package manager used to install front-end packages (like Polymer).

**To install dependencies:**

1) Check your Node.js version.

```sh
node --version
```

The version should be at or above 0.12.x. [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installing-node.js-via-package-manager)

2) If you don't have Node.js installed, or you have a lower version, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and click on the big green Install button.

3) Install `gulp` and `bower` globally.

```sh
npm install -g gulp bower
```

This lets you run `gulp` and `bower` from the command line.

4) Install the starter kit's local `npm` and `bower` dependencies.

```sh
cd polymer-starter-kit-plus && npm install && bower install
```

This installs the element sets (Paper, Iron, Platinum) and tools the starter kit requires to build and serve apps.

### 3. Development workflow

#### Check out the config.js

Gulp variables are in the file [config.js](https://github.com/StartPolymer/polymer-starter-kit-plus/blob/master/config.js)

#### Initializing your app

-	[Download newest script analytics.js](https://github.com/StartPolymer/polymer-starter-kit-plus#download-newest-script-analyticsjs)
-	[Download Google Fonts](https://github.com/StartPolymer/polymer-starter-kit-plus#download-google-fonts)

```sh
gulp init
```

#### Serve / watch

```sh
gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.

#### Build and serve the output from the dist build

```sh
gulp serve:dist
gulp serve:gae
```

#### Run tests

```sh
gulp test:local
```

This runs the unit tests defined in the `app/test` directory through [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

To run tests Java 7 or higher is required. To update Java go to http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html and download ***JDK*** and install it.

#### Build & Vulcanize

```sh
gulp
```

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes linting as well as vulcanization, image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification.

### 4. Deploy app :tada:

How to setup [Google App Engine](https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-gae)

#### Deploy to development environment

```sh
gulp deploy:dev
```

#### Deploy to staging environment

```sh
gulp deploy:stag
```

#### Deploy to production environment

```sh
gulp deploy:prod
```

#### Promote the staging version to the production environment

```sh
gulp deploy:promote
```

Tools
-----

### Download newest script analytics.js

You need download newest script analytics.js from Google, because link https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js has set only 2 hours cache. Here is [analytics.js changelog](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/changelog). Local copy of this script is for better load page performance.

```sh
gulp download:analytics
```

### Download Google Fonts

Download Google Fonts for load page performance and offline using. Fonts list for download is in file [fonts.list](https://github.com/StartPolymer/polymer-starter-kit-plus/blob/master/fonts.list).

```sh
gulp download:fonts
```

### PageSpeed Insights

```sh
gulp pagespeed
```

Service Worker
--------------

Polymer Starter Kit Plus offers an offline experience thanks to Service Worker and the [Platinum Service Worker elements](https://github.com/PolymerElements/platinum-sw). New to Service Worker? Read the following [introduction](https://github.com/PolymerElements/polymer-starter-kit#service-worker) to understand how it works.

Unit Testing
------------

Web apps built with Polymer Starter Kit come configured with support for [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester) - Polymer's preferred tool for authoring and running unit tests. This makes testing your element based applications a pleasant experience.

[Read more](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester#html-suites) about using Web Component tester.

Extending
---------

Use a [recipes](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp/blob/master/docs/recipes/README.md) or [recipes](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/tree/master/docs/recipes) for integrating other popular technologies like CoffeeScript or Jade.
